
It seems that many ST7032i has no problem
But some chip cause problem below;
1. Ack don't become to low bwcause poor drive.
2. This chip soetimes don't reply any ACK.

I don't know trouble about problem1.
But charLCD I bought cause problem2.
This is caused by using i2c-word for PF5.5.
After accessing EC@ or EC!, SDA-line become to low. 
This is bug.  In case of eeprom this has no problem. 
Before using word inside i2c_utility_0.4, it must execute '0 dira COG!'.
In case of polite i2c-devices( DS1337,DS3231, etc), it has no problem.
But ST7032i sometimes cause to reply NACK(i2c-error) only first time.
To prevent this, SDA-line must be clear by polite i2c-devices only first time when .
